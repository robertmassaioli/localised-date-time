## Privacy Policy

This App runs exclusively on the Atlassian Cloud platform and does not send data outside of Atlassian Cloud.

It requires access to user details only such that it can tell what their configured "Time Zone" is and it
requires access to its own Macro Configuratino data so that it knows what date-times to show to the users.
